## 👋 Hi there, I'm Ros

Currently training AI on brand voice and documenting workflows at a high-growth media company. I’m a Creative Project Manager pivoting into AI-powered systems — quietly, intentionally, and with just enough rebellion to get noticed. 

🌱 Loading: AI Workflow Architect, building smarter systems for content, teams, and growth.

---

## 🚀 Strategic Focus
- No-code AI implementation for creative workflows  
- Workflow architecture that respects brand, tone, and time  
- Portfolio-ready builds and measurable success metrics
