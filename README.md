## 👋 Hi there, I'm Ros

Currently designing AI-powered content systems and documenting automation workflows for a high-growth media company. I’m a Creative Project Manager pivoting into AI-powered systems — quietly, intentionally, and with just enough rebellion to get noticed. 

🌱 Loading: AI Workflow Architect, building smarter systems for content, teams, and growth.

---

## 🚀 Strategic Focus
- No-code AI implementation for creative workflows  
- Workflow architecture that respects brand, tone, and time  
- Portfolio-ready builds and measurable success metrics
- Modular AI tools for brand voice, promo flow, and repurposing
- System design that scales human creativity, not replaces it

## 🔧 What I’m Working On

- 🗣️🤖 [**Brand Voice Trainer**](https://github.com/RosTalbot/brand-voice-trainer): Solving review bottlenecks with a custom GPT-4 assistant trained on brand voice frameworks to support autonomous content creation.

- 🎬✨ [**Content Repurposer AI**](https://github.com/RosTalbot/content-repurposer-ai): Ditching clunky clip tools _(Opus.Pro, I love you but…)_ to generate short-form content that actually tells a story.

- 🎙️🌊 [**PromoFlow AI**](https://github.com/RosTalbot/promoflow-ai): Automating podcast promo creation with AI — titles, thumbnails, reels, and more — from long-form content.
