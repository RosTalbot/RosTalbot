## 👋 Hi there, I'm Ros

Currently training AI on brand voice and documenting workflows at a high-growth media company. I’m a Creative Project Manager pivoting into AI-powered systems — quietly, intentionally, and with just enough rebellion to get noticed. 

🌱 Loading: AI Workflow Architect, building smarter systems for content, teams, and growth.

---

## 🚀 Strategic Focus
- No-code AI implementation for creative workflows  
- Workflow architecture that respects brand, tone, and time  
- Portfolio-ready builds and measurable success metrics

## 🔧 What I’m Working On

- 🧠 **Brand Voice Checker AI** — Eliminating content review bottlenecks with Claris-based AI that maintains brand authenticity while enabling team autonomy.
- 🎬 **AI Content Repurposer** — Replacing clunky AI clip tools *(Opus.Pro, I love you but…)* with short-form video that actually tells a full story.
- 🤖 **n8n Workflow Documentation** — Expanding my YouTube ops experience and documenting real-world automations for portfolio case study #3.

## 🎯 My Background

- 9+ years as a founding creative team member scaling a podcast/YouTube/media empire to 80K+ subscribers.
- 800+ podcast episodes produced, 500+ YouTube videos reviewed, 1,000+ contractors trained via online programs.
- Oversaw multi-brand content ecosystems with radically different voices, vibes, and conversion paths.
- Recent work includes training AI (Claris & ChatGPT) on gritty, founder-led brand voices to avoid content dilution.
